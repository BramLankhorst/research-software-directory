# What is the Research Software Directory?

Here is an example of what a product page may look like:

While the content
shown on the product page can be completely customized, by default it includes a
_Mentions_ section, which can be used to characterize the context in which the
software exists. The context may include links to scientific papers, but is
certainly broader than that: for example, there may be links to web applications
that demonstrate the use of the software, there may be links to videos on
YouTube, tutorials on readthedocs.io or Jupyter notebooks, or there may be links
to blog posts; really, anything that helps visitors decide if the software could
be useful for them.

The Research Software Directory improves findability of software packages,
partly because it provides metadata that helps search engines understand what
the software is about, but more importantly because of the human centered text
snippets that must be provided for each software package. After all, discovery
of a software package is often not so much about finding it but knowing that you
found it.
