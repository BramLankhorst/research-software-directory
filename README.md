## What is the Research Software Directory?

The Research Software Directory is a content management system that is tailored
to software.

The idea is that institutes for whom research software is an important output,
can run their own instance of the Research Software Directory. The system is
designed to be flexible enough to allow for different data sources, database
schemas, and so on. By default, the Research Software Directory is set up to
collect data from GitHub, Zenodo, Zotero, as well as Medium blogs.

For each software package, a _product page_ can be created on the Research
Software Directory if the software is deemed useful to others. Here is an
example of what a product page may look like:

## What Research Software Directory can do for you
- Improves findability of software packages
- Includes metadata to help search engines understand what a given software package is about
- Harvests data from Zotero, Zenodo, GitHub, as well as other sources, and presents software packages within their social and scientific context
- Promotes dissemination of software
- Modular system that is meant to be customizable, e.g. with respect to branding, database schemas, an so on
- Makes scientific impact visible in a qualitative way
- Helps decision-making based on metrics and graphs
- Provides metadata via OAI-PMH, the standard protocol for metadata harvesting
